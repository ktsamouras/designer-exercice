## Additional notes
Additionally to the notes inside of the code, I would like to add:
- I will use the BEM methodology to organize any additional custom styles for the exercice.
- Most of the time, I will use helper classes provided from Bootstrap. You will also find some of my own.
- I only imported what I needed from Bootstrap for performance purposes.
- I am using autoprefixer (along with other things) in gulp to take care of all the web browser prefixes.
- Concerning the calendar/scheduler, I took the opportunity to learn about the CSS grid layout to build it (I generally use flexbox). Also, I don't usually use inline styles, but I made an exception for the placement of the events on the timeline (the way I did it, I didn't think it made sense to use a multitude of classes to place them).
- For the icons, I used an external library called Font Awesome.
- There is definitively room for improvement (accessibility, usability, (SEO), performance, ...).
